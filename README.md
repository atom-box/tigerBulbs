# This is a pedagogical playground

## Gulp
I am trying different Gulp-based things with the workflow.  I am learning how to better roll my own NPM w/o any instructions.

## Logic JS 
The JS logic is the kind of little thing I assume I might whiteboard someday.  

## DOM JS
I am practicing grabbing and altering the DOM.

## Tiger Statistics
My content is based on Detroit Tigers statistics and also the [Lightbulbs switcher](https://coderbyte.com/ebook) problem.  The statistics was trivial for median and mean but I think mode was a good jumping off point for a whole genre of problems.  I solved it recursively.  I think you learn how to return up through the stack on a recursive function it is neat and clear looking, not obfuscation at all...
